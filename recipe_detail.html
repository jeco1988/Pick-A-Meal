            <h4>Healthy Shrimp Dinner Recipes: 8 Ways to Get More Omega-3s</h4>
            <p>Shrimp is the most-consumed seafood in the United States, and for good reason. In addition to just being delicious, shrimp is a good source of protein, omega-3 fatty acids, and even vitamin D, which can be difficult to get from food. Shrimp is also low in mercury, and wild-caught shrimp is less likely to contain toxins than farmed.</p>

            <p>Who doesn't love American-style shrimp scampi? Garlicky, buttery shrimp served on a bed of carby goodness? Sign me up (but only during sweater season please!) Indeed, all that butter doesn't typically make for a light meal. Luckily, there are some low calorie shrimp scampi recipes out there. We also love the sound of the recipe below, with cherry tomatoes, garlic, white wine, and a touch of cream.</p>
