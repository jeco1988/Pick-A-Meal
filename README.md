# Pick-A-Meal

The one-stop webpage for finding all of your favourite recipes.

## Description

A basic recipe search database that allows the user to input keywords and retrieve multiple recipe suggestions. Users will then be able to save those recipes in a 'favourites' list which saves to the local storage. Once users have clicked through to their desired search result, suggested YouTube recipe videos will also appear.
